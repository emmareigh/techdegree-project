        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I have taken a hiatus from web design and development the last couple of years. While I've continued to update websites, dabbled in graphics and animations it has dawned on me how much I enjoy all of these things. I am excited to emerse myself back into all of them and begin freelancing. </p>
        <p>The last couple of years I have been working in the outdoor industry which has allowed me some amazing opportunities. While my roles have been primarily customer service based, I have also worked with companies creating graphics for marketing and social media, along with web maintenance and updates.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'd like to use web and graphic design to create visually pleasing and informative websites for clients.</p>
